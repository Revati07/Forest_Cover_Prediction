 # Forest Cover Type Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the type of forest cover based on cartographic and soil attributes of a 30m x 30m patch of forest land using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm.

---

# Problem Statement

Given cartographic variables such as elevation, slope, soil type, and wilderness area, predict the forest cover type (1 to 7) of a given land patch.

---

#  Dataset

- ðŸ“„ File: `forest prediction.csv`
- Contains:
  - 54 features (e.g., Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Soil Types)
  - `Cover_Type`: The target variable (Classes 1 to 7)

---

#  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost

---

#  Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed non-essential columns (`Id`)
   - Standardized features using `StandardScaler`
   - Adjusted class labels from 1â€“7 to 0â€“6

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Visualized class distribution
   - Explored correlations among features

3. **Model Training**
   - Used `XGBoostClassifier` with `mlogloss` as the evaluation metric
   - Achieved **~86â€“87% accuracy**

4. **Evaluation**
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix
   - Feature importance plot

---

#  Results

- âœ… Accuracy: ~86.5%
- ðŸ“Š Confusion matrix and classification metrics showed reliable multi-class classification performance.
